# Password Generator - Mark Wilson

In this project I have created a random password generator using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The user is prompted for the length and character types of the password and once the criteria is given correctly a password is generated.
- The prompts will repeat until a valid entry is given or the user presses cancel for more user friendliness.
- It is important to insure the password generated contains at least 1 of each charter type selected as some websites require strict criteria for passwords.
